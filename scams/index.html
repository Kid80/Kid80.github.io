		<h1>Phishing</h1>
		<h3>What is phishing?</h3>
		<p>Phishing is a form of scam. It is when emails are sent, usually using a bot, inviting you to click on a link. This link will often direct to you a form, asking for your personal data.</p>
		<h3>How to detect a Phishing Scam?</h3>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>The email is not directly addressed to you.</li>
			<li>The email will often say something bad will happen if you click on the link(such as your bank account may be blocked)</li>
			<li>The link will have the prefix "http" (which is unencrypted), rather than "https" (which is encrypted)</li>
